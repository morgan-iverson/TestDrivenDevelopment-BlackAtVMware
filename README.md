# TestDrivenDevelopment-BlackAtVMware
This repository contains the code for the Black@VMware Black Heritage Month Test Driven Development Webinar lead by [Morgan Iverson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwiverson/) and [Gregory Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-green-5619748/).

**Want to develop a cool math game?**

This project will be used develop the backend of a bug free addition game!

During this session, we will cover software testing methods.

We will discuss challenges with building bug-free software with previous testing approaches.
We will provide an overview of Test-Driven-Development (TDD) and explain how it helps.
We will demonstrate building a math game using TDD.
Students should be familiar with a minimum of 1 programming languageâ€™s basic concept.
These concepts should include objects, variables, methods, and if-then-else logic.



The following is a summary of the projects in this repository.
